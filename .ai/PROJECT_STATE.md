# Project state

Verified 2026-11-13 by Codex. Wavelength/Meld is an Android Kotlin app.

Main now contains the existing feat/local-folders implementation and the audiobook phone-player improvements, merged in PR #1 at d3b6df1e29f61bb2fa2ed7fc3d3e693957d4cd1c. The 106 existing feature-branch commits and other agents' work were preserved.

Published release: [Wavelength 0.9.2.81](https://github.com/rickevans86/Meld/releases/tag/v0.9.2.81), target main. Tag points to d3b6df1e. Wavelength.apk is public, signed, application ID com.meld.app.debug, version code 280081 (previous 280080). APK signature and certificate match release 0.9.2.80.

Phone player: separate chapter navigation, independently configurable rewind/forward under Settings > Features > Audiobooks (defaults 15/30 seconds), chapter picker, device-local bookmarks, speed and sleep timer access. Mini-player and media-session skips use the same saved preferences. Audiobookshelf chapter metadata is persisted and mapped across audio files. Local books use available file-based chapters.

Validation: six focused audiobook tests and local FOSS debug APK build passed. Full PR test suite, APK build and lint passed on a0d483fc; merged main has the identical code tree. Signed release workflow 43361593932 succeeded. Physical-device testing remains outstanding.

GitHub Issues are disabled (creating an issue returned HTTP 410). No remote Issue claim is asserted; PR #1 and .ai records identify Codex's completed task. Legacy GMS nightly workflow 43361593972 failed for missing signing secrets; the published FOSS release is unaffected.
